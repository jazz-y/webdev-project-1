            <h2>What Breed is Fluffy?</h2>
    <p>Fluffy is a mix between a maltese mother and a poodle father. Since Maltese dogs are small, the poodle parent is often a toy or miniature size, with typical lifespan of 10 - 15 years. Maltipoo height and weight varies based on the parent poodle, often 8 to 14 inches tall and 5 to 20 pounds. Their coats can be scruffy, wavy, or curly with a white, silver, blue, grey, brown, black, cream, or come combination of colors. </p>

            <h2>Maltipoo Behavior</h2>
    <p>Maltipoos are often very affectionate and loving towards their owners, and are prone to getting extremely attached to their owners, often becoming close with everyone in the family. Maltipoos are great for families, although it's recommended that children be a little older to avoid accidentally hurting your Maltipoo. As with many small dog breeds, they can get attached to one particular person. It's common for Maltipoos to develop separation anxiety when left alone for long periods of time. It's important that you socialize your Maltipoo early to prevent behavioral issues in the future, such as excessive barking, destructive behavior, and aggression towards outsiders.</p>

    <p>Maltipoos are known for being extremely intelligent and playful, often displaying a curious and energetic personality. They are quick learners and enjoy interactive games and training sessions. It is recommended that you start training your Maltipoo puppy as soon and consistently as you can to reinforce good behavior, at least 15 minutes a day.</p>

            <h2>Maltipoo Health</h2>
    <p>Maltipoos are generally healthy dogs, but like all breeds, they are susceptible to some more than others, often those that are an issue in the Maltese and Poodle parent breeds. Some of the most common health problems are Patellar Lucation (kneecap dislocation), dental issues, allergies, and skin problems. A good diet, brushing teeth and coat, and dental treats are good ways to maintain their health and safeguard against their predispositions.</p>
